# Brief Introduction:
In the past 70 years, Airplane has been an important tool for people to travel long distances. According to [IATA annual report](https://www.iata.org/pressroom/pr/Documents/2017-03-10-01-CN.pdf) In 2016, the major aviation accident rate was 0.39, which was equivalent to only one major accident happen in every 2.56 million flights. This seemingly safe number is built on countless blood and sweat. Step down and turn back a little bit, let’s count the successes and failures in the flying history.<br>

# Data Analysis:

### Data Set:
- [Government data from Socrata.com Airplane Crashes and Fatalities Since 1908](https://opendata.socrata.com/Government/Airplane-Crashes-and-Fatalities-Since-1908/q2te-8cvq)<br>

- [World Cities Database Latitude and longitude of cities worldwide](https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities)<br>

- [The World Bank Air transport, registered carrier departures worldwide](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IS.AIR.DPRT)<br>

### Data Volume:
   5534
### Analysis Dimension:

- Yearly how many planes crashed? any trend? how many people were on board? how many survived? how many died?
- How the distribution of accidents between military and passengers? any insights?
- The highest number of crashes by operator and type of aircraft. The relationship between operators and types of airplanes?
- Find the airline routes with most accidents and try to find the reasons.
- Find any interesting trends/behaviors that we encounter when we analyze the dataset.

### Limitations and Weakness:
- There are flaws in data analysis methodology.
- Without in-depth knowledge of history and airplanes.
- the visualization part could be better.
